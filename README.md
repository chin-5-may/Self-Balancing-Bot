# Self-Balancing Bot â€” Self Project
### IIT Bombay | 2024

This project focuses on the development and simulation of a **self-balancing robot** using **MATLAB Simulink**, with an emphasis on achieving stability and precise movement control.

## Key Features:

- **Simulation in MATLAB Simulink**:
  - Developed and simulated a self-balancing robot model.
  - The system was designed to maintain stability during dynamic movements and varying conditions.
  
- **PID Control System**:
  - Implemented two separate **PID controllers**:
    1. **Vertical Angle Regulation**: A PID controller was used to regulate the vertical angle of the robot, ensuring balance by keeping the robot upright.
    2. **Horizontal Position Control**: Another PID controller managed the horizontal positioning, ensuring the robot remained close to its intended position even when subjected to external disturbances.
  
- **PID Gains Optimization**:
  - The **P** (Proportional), **I** (Integral), and **D** (Derivative) gains of the PID controllers were fine-tuned to improve the robot's response.
  - Achieved **improved balance recovery** by reducing oscillations and adjusting the gains for smoother transitions.
  
- **Real-World Simulation**:
  - The system was optimized for stability under varying load and ground conditions, making it robust to different real-world scenarios.

## Achievements:
- Enhanced the system's ability to recover balance rapidly after disturbances.
- Maintained a stable horizontal position with minimal drift from the original location.
- Optimized performance for diverse operational environments.

This self-balancing bot showcases a detailed simulation approach using control theory, specifically leveraging PID controllers to maintain both angular and positional stability.
